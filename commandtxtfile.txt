#after listing the files by using ls command we will get some files and folders 
#where cd to sites-available we will find  file called default that file contains nginx default configuration like server_name,port,return message,etc and also nginx html file path 
cd /var/www/html 
#now we will get the html files

#after changing the index-file we have to validate the nginx

#All the content inside a nginx configuration is nothing but directives. Directives are of two types
    1.Simple Directives 
        -listen
        -server_name
        -return 
        -etc 
    these are terminated with a semi-colon (;)
    2.Block Directives
        -events
        -http
        -server
        -etc
    these are like loops ({})
